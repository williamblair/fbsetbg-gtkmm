fbsetbg-gtkmm - frontend for fbsetbg, the fluxbox background setter

BASIC INFO:
-------------------
I've supplied binaries for x86 and x64 computers in the
respective folders 'x86' and 'x86_64'

requires the gtkmm library to run, which can be installed
on Debian/Ubuntu-ish systems with:

	sudo apt-get install libgtkmm-3.0-1

To compile yourself, see the COMPILING MANUALLY section

Add images to choose from by pressing the 'Add Directory' button.
You can also set fbsetbg options by selecting from Fullscreen, Centered,
Tiled, and Aspect; which represent the -f, -c, -t, and -a options
respectively.

FBSETBG ERRORS:
---------------------------
On Archlinux, fbsetbg gave me a couple of errors at first:
xmessage: command not found  <-- solution: install xorg-xmessage

And, because fbsetbg is a wrapper, you need one of fluxbox's
supported tools to actually set the wallpaper; it suggests installing
esetroot, feh, or wmsetbg. Since feh is the only one of these
currently contained in Arch's repos, install that and you should
be fine.

RUNNING IN FLUXBOX:
----------------------------------
I personally made a directory ~/.fluxbox/applications (not
to be confused with the 'apps' file), and copied the binary there,
then added it to my menu file; but you could run the program from anywhere

To add it to your menu, create an entry similar to this somewhere
in ~/.fluxbox/menu:

	...
	[exec] (Change Background) {/PATH/TO/BINARY} </path/to/icon>
	...

That's it!

COMPILING MANUALLY:
-------------------
to compile fbsetbg-gtk yourself, you will need g++, make, and gtk3
these can be installed on Debian/Ubuntu-ish systems with:

	sudo apt-get install g++
	sudo apt-get install make
	sudo apt-get install libgtkmm-3.0-dev
	sudo ldconfig

then compile with:

	make

In the directory you're reading this README from
This will result in a binary in this same root directory

Enjoy! :)
